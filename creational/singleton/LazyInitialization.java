/*
Pros:
Object is created only if it is needed. It may overcome resource overcome and wastage of CPU time.
Exception handling is also possible in method.

Cons:
Every time a condition of null has to be checked.
instance canâ€™t be accessed directly.
In multithreaded environment, it may break singleton property.
